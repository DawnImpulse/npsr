# Node Package Script Runner
The package is used to run your package.json scripts easily using either `ns` or `npsr` command without writing `npm run` everytime

E.g.
Suppose you have two scripts in your package.json namely **build** & **coverage**. You can run them directly with either of the below commands
```
ns build 
```
```
npsr coverage
```

### Release
The package is expected to be released in early March '2020
